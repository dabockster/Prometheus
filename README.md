Prometheus
===========

### Group project for CSCE 320 at Pacific Lutheran University

Prometheus is a small Java program that allows the user to play a game called Gomoku.

For more information on Gomoku:

NOTE: This program requires a minimum of Java 8 installed.

### Setup

Run the .jar file from the ```releases``` folder.

NOTE: This program is not compatible with Mac OS X. There are several graphical bugs in regards to how OS X renders Java Swing objects. Because of time constraints in our class, we will not have a chance to implement fixes for these graphics bugs.

Windows and Linux should be unaffected.
